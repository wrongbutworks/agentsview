title: Remote Access
description: Access AgentsView from other devices on your network
---

AgentsView binds to `127.0.0.1` by default, so only your local machine can reach
it. To make the UI available from other devices, you need to do two things:

- listen on a non-loopback address or put the server behind a proxy
- require a bearer token for API access

In current releases, bearer-token auth is controlled by `require_auth`.

## Quick Setup

Enable auth in `~/.agentsview/config.toml`:

```toml
require_auth = true
```

Then start the server on a non-loopback interface:

```bash
agentsview serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

To make the bind persistent — so restarts, auto-started daemons, and reboots
keep the server reachable — set `host` in `config.toml` instead of passing
the flag each time:

```toml
host = "0.0.0.0"
```

A non-loopback `host` in `config.toml` requires `require_auth = true`; the
server refuses to start rather than persistently exposing an unauthenticated
API. The `--host` flag remains available for one-off unauthenticated binds.

When this command runs inside WSL, AgentsView advertises the WSL `eth0` address
instead of `127.0.0.1` so the printed URL is usable from the Windows host and
nearby LAN clients. An explicit `--public-url` still takes precedence.

When auth is enabled, AgentsView generates a token if needed and stores it in
`~/.agentsview/config.toml`. Open `http://<your-ip>:8080` from another device
and enter the configured token in the frontend, or send it in an
`Authorization` header.

!!! note

    Older configs may still use `remote_access = true`. AgentsView still reads
    that legacy key, but new setups should use `require_auth = true`.

## Authentication

When `require_auth` is enabled, all `/api/` requests must include:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The token is stored in `config.toml` as `auth_token`. It is generated
automatically the first time auth is enabled, so you do not need to mint one
manually. For supervised services or temporary overrides, set
`AGENTSVIEW_AUTH_TOKEN`; it takes precedence over the config file.

Auth is enforced on API routes, not on static assets. That means a browser can
load the HTML shell, but API requests fail with `401` until the correct token is
supplied.

When `require_auth` is disabled, normal local loopback use remains ungated.

## HTTP Remote Sync

Configured `[[remote_hosts]]` entries can use `transport = "http"` when the
remote machine is already running an AgentsView daemon:

```toml
[[remote_hosts]]
host = "devbox1"
transport = "http"
url = "http://devbox1.tailnet.ts.net:8080"
token = "remote-token"
```

The daemon on the remote machine must bind a non-loopback interface (set
`host = "0.0.0.0"` with `require_auth = true` in its config.toml) or every
sync fails with a connection-refused error. See
[Remote Hosts](/configuration/#remote-hosts) for the full remote-side setup,
including keeping detached daemons alive.

Use `require_auth = true` on remote nodes when practical, or at minimum keep
their generated `auth_token` configured. The remote archive endpoints always
require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, even when the rest of the daemon API is
unauthenticated. The `token` in the collector's `remote_hosts` entry must match
the remote daemon's `auth_token` and is required for HTTP remote sync. Do not
reuse the collector daemon's own `auth_token` for untrusted remote endpoints.

The HTTP transport is intended for private networking such as Tailscale or an
equivalent restricted overlay. Do not expose raw archive endpoints directly to
the public internet.

HTTP remote sync failures are summarized without echoing remote-controlled URLs
or response bodies. Common summaries point at the specific fix: a rejected token
means the collector's per-host `token` does not match the remote daemon's
`auth_token`; a missing endpoint means the remote host needs a newer
AgentsView; connection refusal usually means the daemon is not running, is still
bound to loopback, or the URL port is wrong; DNS and timeout messages point back
to the configured `url`.

For always-available fleet nodes launched with `agentsview serve --background`,
set:

```toml
daemon_idle_timeout = "0s"
```

That setting controls detached background daemons only. Supervised daemons run
under systemd, launchd, Docker, or a foreground shell never create the idle
tracker and already stay alive until their supervisor stops them.

## Incremental Sync

HTTP remote sync is incremental. The first sync downloads the full session
archive and stores a byte-for-byte mirror under
`<data_dir>/remote-mirrors/<host>-<hash>/`; subsequent syncs fetch a file
manifest, diff it against the mirror, and download only files that changed
on the remote. Archives are gzip-compressed in transit.

The mirror is a disposable transfer cache: deleting it is always safe and
just makes the next sync download everything again. Sessions already
imported into the database are never removed, even when their source files
disappear from the remote.

When the remote daemon predates the manifest endpoint, sync automatically
falls back to the full-archive download, so mixed versions keep working.

## SSE Endpoints

The SSE endpoints also accept `?token=<token>` because browser `EventSource`
cannot set custom headers:

```text
http://<host>:8080/api/v1/events?token=<token>
http://<host>:8080/api/v1/sessions/<id>/watch?token=<token>
```

Use header-based auth for normal API calls whenever possible.

## Public URL And Trusted Origins

When you access AgentsView through a hostname or reverse proxy, tell the server
about the public URL:

```bash
agentsview serve --public-url https://agents.example.com
```

For additional trusted origins, use `--public-origin`:

```bash
agentsview serve \
  --public-origin https://agents.example.com \
  --public-origin https://internal.example.com
```

Flags can also be comma-separated:

```bash
agentsview serve --public-origin https://a.example.com,https://b.example.com
```

These can also be persisted:

```toml
public_url = "https://agents.example.com"
public_origins = [
  "https://agents.example.com",
  "https://internal.example.com",
]
```

### Forwarded Dev Environments

AgentsView validates the request `Host` header before serving API requests. That
protects local loopback servers from DNS-rebinding attacks, but it also means
SSH port forwards, reverse proxies, WSL2, Codespaces, Coder, and similar remote
development environments must use a trusted public URL or origin.

Static assets can still load in these environments because the HTML shell is
intentionally less strict than `/api/` routes. The dashboard may appear briefly,
then `/api/v1/settings` or another API request can fail with `403 Forbidden` if
the browser `Host` is the forwarded hostname rather than one of the local
allowed hosts.

Restart the server with the exact origin you open in the browser:

```bash
# exe.dev browser URL: https://<vm>.exe.xyz
agentsview serve --public-url https://<vm>.exe.xyz

# ssh -L 18080:127.0.0.1:8080 host
# Browser opens http://127.0.0.1:18080
agentsview serve --public-url http://127.0.0.1:18080
```

`--public-url` must match the browser origin exactly, including the scheme,
hostname, and non-default port. When the browser sends an untrusted `Host`,
current releases return `403 Forbidden` with a response body that explains the
rejected host, the allowed set, and the `--public-url` fix. The Settings page
shows the same actionable message instead of prompting for an auth token. A
short breadcrumb is also written to the server debug log.

### Troubleshooting Forwarded Access

If the UI flashes and then the dashboard or settings page fails, check the
`/api/v1/settings` request in browser devtools:

| Symptom or check                              | Meaning                                    | Fix                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/v1/settings` returns `401 Unauthorized` | Bearer-token auth is enabled               | Use the token printed by the server or stored in `~/.agentsview/config.toml` |
| `/api/v1/settings` returns `403 Forbidden`    | The browser host or origin was rejected    | Restart with `agentsview serve --public-url <exact-browser-origin>`          |
| `/api/v1/settings` goes to an unexpected host | The frontend has a saved remote server URL | Clear `localStorage.getItem("agentsview-server-url")` for this site          |

To clear an unintended saved server URL, run this in the browser console and
reload:

```js
localStorage.removeItem("agentsview-server-url")
location.reload()
```

## Managed Caddy Mode

AgentsView can manage a [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) reverse proxy for
TLS-terminated access. The AgentsView backend stays on loopback while Caddy
handles the public socket.

!!! warning "Enable auth first"

    Managed Caddy exposes a public endpoint. Set `require_auth = true` in
    `~/.agentsview/config.toml` before starting the server, or the proxy will
    front an unauthenticated API. See [Quick Setup](#quick-setup).

```bash
agentsview serve \
  --public-url https://agents.example.com \
  --proxy caddy \
  --tls-cert /path/to/cert.pem \
  --tls-key /path/to/key.pem
```

| Flag                | Default     | Description                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `--proxy`           |             | Proxy mode — currently `caddy`                        |
| `--caddy-bin`       | `caddy`     | Path to the Caddy binary                              |
| `--proxy-bind-host` | `127.0.0.1` | Interface for Caddy to bind                           |
| `--public-port`     | `8443`      | External port for the public URL                      |
| `--tls-cert`        |             | TLS certificate file path                             |
| `--tls-key`         |             | TLS key file path                                     |
| `--allowed-subnet`  |             | Client CIDR allowlist (repeatable or comma-separated) |

Caddy must already be installed and available on `PATH` unless you override it
with `--caddy-bin`.

### Subnet Allowlists

When using a non-loopback bind host for Caddy, restrict access to specific
networks. Subnet allowlists complement bearer-token auth rather than replacing
it — `require_auth = true` should still be set before binding Caddy off
loopback.

```bash
agentsview serve \
  --proxy caddy \
  --proxy-bind-host 0.0.0.0 \
  --allowed-subnet 192.168.1.0/24 \
  --allowed-subnet 10.0.0.0/8
```

Requests from outside the allowed subnets receive `403`.

## Settings Page

Remote access can also be configured from the Settings page. The **Remote
Access** section lets you:

- toggle `require_auth`
- view the auto-generated auth token
- connect the frontend to another AgentsView server by URL and token

![Settings remote access](/assets/generated/screenshots/settings-remote.png)

Changes that affect bind or auth behavior may require a server restart.

| `proxy.allowed_subnets` | CIDR allowlist for proxy connections                                       |

For LAN access you still need a non-loopback bind such as
`agentsview serve --host 0.0.0.0`. `require_auth` controls API auth; it does not
change the bind address by itself.
