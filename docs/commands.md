## Commands

### `agentsview serve`

Start the HTTP server with embedded web UI.

```bash
agentsview serve [flags]
```

As of 0.23.0, starting the server requires the explicit `serve` subcommand.
Running plain `agentsview` shows help instead of starting the web UI.

| Flag                | Default     | Description                                              |
| ------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--host`            | `127.0.0.1` | Host to bind to                                          |
| `--port`            | `8080`      | Port to listen on                                        |
| `--no-browser`      | `false`     | Don't open browser on startup                            |
| `--no-update-check` | `false`     | Disable automatic update checks                          |
| `--background`      | `false`     | Start `agentsview serve` as a managed background process |
| `--replace`         | `false`     | Replace a running local daemon before starting           |
| `--public-url`      |             | Public URL for hostname or proxy access                  |
| `--public-origin`   |             | Trusted browser origin (repeatable/comma-separated)      |
| `--proxy`           |             | Managed proxy mode (`caddy`)                             |
| `--caddy-bin`       | `caddy`     | Caddy binary path                                        |
| `--proxy-bind-host` | `127.0.0.1` | Interface for managed proxy                              |
| `--public-port`     | `8443`      | External port for managed proxy                          |
| `--tls-cert`        |             | TLS certificate path                                     |
| `--tls-key`         |             | TLS key path                                             |
| `--allowed-subnet`  |             | Client CIDR allowlist (repeatable/comma-separated)       |

The server auto-discovers an available port if `8080` is busy. See
[Remote Access](/remote-access/) for details on the remote access and proxy
flags.

**Examples:**

```bash
agentsview serve                                # defaults
agentsview serve --port 9090                    # custom port
agentsview serve --no-browser                   # disable browser auto-open
agentsview serve --background                   # start managed background server
agentsview serve --replace                      # replace an existing daemon
agentsview serve --public-url https://agents.example.com
```

On startup, the server:

1. Loads or creates `~/.agentsview/sessions.db`
1. Runs initial sync across all discovered session directories
1. Starts the file watcher (500ms debounce)
1. Starts periodic sync (every 15 minutes)
1. Serves the Svelte SPA and REST API

The server shuts down cleanly on `Ctrl+C`, flushing the database and stopping
file watchers.

#### Background Mode

Use `--background` when you want the web UI to keep running after the launching
shell exits:

```bash
agentsview serve --background
agentsview serve status
agentsview serve stop
```

The parent command starts a detached `agentsview serve` process, waits briefly
for it to publish its runtime record, and prints the URL, PID, and log path.
Background server output is written to `~/.agentsview/serve.log`. `serve status`
reports the managed process, URL, version, uptime, and read-only mode when
available. `serve stop` gracefully terminates the managed process and cleans up
its runtime record.

When a writable daemon is already running, a newer release binary automatically
replaces an older compatible daemon before starting. Development builds,
downgrades, and forward API/data-version conflicts do not auto-replace; use
`--replace` when you deliberately want this invocation to stop the running
daemon first. If the SQLite archive itself has a newer data version than the
current binary can open, `serve` refuses before stopping the old daemon.
`serve status` reports incompatible live daemons with their daemon and binary
versions plus the `--replace` or `serve stop` actions.

Background servers also act as the shared local daemon for the desktop app and
CLI. The daemon owns local SQLite writes for its data directory, so common write
and freshness-sensitive commands proxy to it instead of opening the archive as a
second writer. A background daemon self-exits after the idle timeout when no
external request or daemon-owned job is active. Periodic sync and file-watcher
work prevent exit while they run, but do not keep the daemon alive forever by
themselves.

#### CLI daemon behavior

Most read-only CLI commands do not auto-start the daemon on a cold archive. They
attach to a compatible local daemon when one is already running; otherwise they
open SQLite directly in read-only mode and return the latest indexed data. This
keeps commands such as `session list`, `session get`, `session messages`, and
offline usage reports fast in scripts.

Commands that need fresh data or need to write auto-start the detached daemon
when no compatible daemon is running. That includes local `sync`,
`session sync`, `token-use`, normal `usage` refresh paths,
`pg push`/`pg push --watch`, and `duckdb push`. If a writable daemon is known to
own the archive but is not reachable, these commands refuse instead of writing
directly.

Set `AGENTSVIEW_NO_DAEMON=1` to disable daemon auto-start. With that escape
hatch, read commands use direct read-only SQLite and write commands acquire the
local write-owner lock before opening SQLite. If another process owns that lock,
the command refuses and asks you to stop the daemon, wait for idle shutdown, or
retry after the offline operation finishes.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview sync`

Refresh the local archive. For local sync, the CLI uses the running daemon or
starts a detached daemon so SQLite writes stay owned by one process. Set
`AGENTSVIEW_NO_DAEMON=1` to force a direct offline sync that acquires the local
write-owner lock and exits when done.

```bash
agentsview sync [flags]
```

| Flag     | Default | Description                                    |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `--full` | `false` | Force a full resync regardless of data version |
| `--host` |         | SSH hostname for remote sync                   |
| `--user` |         | SSH username for remote sync                   |
| `--port` | `22`    | SSH port for remote sync                       |

**Examples:**

```bash
agentsview sync           # incremental sync and exit
agentsview sync --full    # full resync and exit
agentsview sync --host buildbox.local
agentsview sync --host buildbox.local --user wes --port 2222
```

After syncing, a summary of session and message counts is printed to stdout.

When `--host` is set, AgentsView syncs only that remote host and fails fast on
error. If the local daemon has a matching configured `[[remote_hosts]]` entry,
the daemon uses that stored entry and its configured transport. Otherwise,
`--host` performs an ad hoc SSH sync: it resolves the supported agent session
directories on the remote machine, transfers the source session data locally,
and indexes it into your local archive.

Local sync can also read configured Claude and Codex roots from S3-compatible
object storage. Add `s3://` entries to `claude_project_dirs` or
`codex_sessions_dirs` in `~/.agentsview/config.toml`, then run `agentsview sync`
normally. This is not SSH remote sync: object storage is treated as a read-only
session source, using object size and `LastModified` metadata to skip unchanged
sessions and downloading only objects that need parsing. See
[Configuration — S3-Compatible Session Sources](/configuration/#s3-compatible-session-sources).

#### Configured Remote Hosts

As of 0.33.0, remote hosts can also be declared in `~/.agentsview/config.toml`
so a single bare `agentsview sync` covers a whole fleet:

```toml
[[remote_hosts]]
host = "buildbox.local"
transport = "ssh" # optional; default
user = "wes"      # optional
port = 2222       # optional, defaults to 22

[[remote_hosts]]
host = "devbox1"
transport = "http"
url = "http://devbox1.tailnet.ts.net:8080"
token = "remote-token"
```

With hosts configured, `agentsview sync` (no `--host`) runs the local sync
first, then syncs each configured host in the order declared using its
configured transport. `--full` applies to every host; for HTTP hosts it forces
a re-parse of every remote session but still transfers only changed files (see
[Incremental Sync](/remote-access/#incremental-sync)). A failing host is
reported on stderr and skipped so the remaining hosts still run; the command
exits non-zero if any host failed.

`agentsview sync --host X` syncs one host, not the whole configured list. When
the local daemon knows a configured host with that identity, it uses the stored
entry and transport so HTTP hosts can be selected by host name. Without a
matching configured host, `--host` remains an ad hoc SSH sync. SSH remote sync
is non-interactive in both forms — it requires key-based passwordless SSH and
never prompts for a password.

HTTP remote sync requires a reachable remote daemon, preferably over a private
network such as Tailscale, and remote archive endpoints always require bearer
auth. The per-host `token` is required and must match the remote daemon's
`auth_token`; do not reuse the collector daemon's own token for untrusted remote
endpoints. Ad hoc HTTP remotes are not supported. Hosts must be unique within
the list, since remote sessions are namespaced by host.

During HTTP remote sync, the collector prints durable phase lines for resolving
remote roots, downloading and extracting the archive, processing sessions, and
the final per-host summary. Archive downloads also show live byte progress when
the remote daemon provides a `Content-Length` header. If an upgraded binary does
not show those phases, restart the local collector daemon; restarting the remote
daemon as well avoids version skew while smoke testing.

### `agentsview prune`

Delete sessions matching one or more filters. At least one filter is required.

```bash
agentsview prune [flags]
```

| Flag              | Default | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--project`       |         | Sessions whose project contains this substring      |
| `--max-messages`  | `-1`    | Sessions with at most N messages                    |
| `--before`        |         | Sessions that ended before this date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `--first-message` |         | Sessions whose first message starts with this text  |
| `--dry-run`       | `false` | Show what would be pruned without deleting          |
| `--yes`           | `false` | Skip confirmation prompt                            |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Preview what would be deleted
agentsview prune --project "scratch" --dry-run

# Delete short sessions from before 2025
agentsview prune --max-messages 2 --before 2025-01-01

# Delete sessions starting with a specific message
agentsview prune --first-message "test" --yes

# Combine filters (AND logic)
agentsview prune --project "old-project" --max-messages 5 --before 2025-06-01
```

The prune command displays the number of sessions deleted and disk space
reclaimed. Use `--dry-run` first to verify the filter matches what you expect.

setup and reporting behavior.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview activity report`

Report active time, concurrency, cost, token, breakdown, and session rows for a
resolved date range. The command uses the same report model as the web UI's
[Activity](/activity/) page.

```bash
agentsview activity report [flags]
```

| Flag         | Default   | Description                                           |

agentsview activity report --preset custom \
  --from 2026-06-20T14:00:00Z \
  --to 2026-06-20T18:00:00Z \
  --bucket 15m
```

The human output prints totals, peak concurrency, top project/model/ agent
breakdowns, and top sessions. JSON output includes the dense bucket timeline and
session rows used by the web UI.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview token-use`

!!! note "Deprecated"

    As of 0.30.0, `agentsview token-use` is a deprecated alias for
    [`agentsview session usage`](/session-api/#agentsview-session-usage). Both
    commands accept the same `<session-id>` argument. `token-use` always emits
    the same JSON shape that `session usage --format json` emits (now extended
    with a cost estimate). New scripts should use `agentsview session usage`.

Print machine-readable token usage data and a cost estimate for a single
session.

```bash
agentsview token-use <session-id>
```

Session ID format depends on the agent. For example, Claude root sessions
usually use UUIDs like `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`, Claude subagents
use IDs like `agent-a86574e`, and some other agents use prefixes such as
`codex:my-session-id`. Raw session IDs emitted by the underlying agent are also
accepted when AgentsView can resolve them back to the canonical stored session.

If the AgentsView server is already running, the command reads the current
database state. If no server is running, it performs an on-demand sync for the
requested session first.

**Example:**

```bash
agentsview token-use 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

```json
{
  "session_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "agent": "claude",
  "project": "my-project",
  "total_output_tokens": 15230,
  "peak_context_tokens": 84000,
  "has_token_data": true,
  "cost_usd": 2.41,
  "has_cost": true,
  "models": ["claude-opus-4-7"],
  "server_running": false
}
```

See [`agentsview session usage`](/session-api/#agentsview-session-usage) for the
full field reference and exit-code contract.

### `agentsview pg push`

Sync sessions from local SQLite to PostgreSQL. See [PostgreSQL Sync](/pg-sync/)
for full documentation.

```bash
agentsview pg push [target] [flags]
```

| Flag                 | Default | Description                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--full`             | `false` | Force full local resync and re-push                            |
| `--projects`         |         | Comma-separated projects to push (inclusive)                   |
| `--exclude-projects` |         | Comma-separated projects to exclude from push                  |
| `--all-projects`     | `false` | Ignore configured project filters for this run                 |
| `--all`              | `false` | Push every configured PostgreSQL target sequentially           |
| `--watch`            | `false` | Run continuously, pushing on change plus a periodic floor      |
| `--debounce`         | `30s`   | Coalesce window after a change before pushing (`--watch` only) |
| `--interval`         | `15m`   | Periodic floor push interval (`--watch` only)                  |

See [PostgreSQL Sync — Project Filtering](/pg-sync/#project-filtering) for
details on how filtering interacts with the push watermark.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview pg status`

Show PostgreSQL sync status.

```bash
agentsview pg status [target] [flags]
```

| Flag                 | Default | Description                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--all`              | `false` | Show status for every configured PostgreSQL target          |
| `--projects`         |         | Comma-separated projects whose push status to show          |
| `--exclude-projects` |         | Comma-separated excluded projects whose push status to show |
| `--all-projects`     | `false` | Ignore configured project filters for this status           |

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview pg serve`

Start a read-only web UI backed by PostgreSQL. See [PostgreSQL Sync](/pg-sync/)
for full documentation.

```bash
agentsview pg serve [flags]
```

Accepts the same serve flags (`--host`, `--port`, `--proxy`, etc.) plus
PostgreSQL configuration from `config.toml`.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview pg service`

Install and manage the PostgreSQL auto-push service, which runs
`agentsview pg push --watch` in the background. Supported service managers are
launchd on macOS and `systemd --user` on Linux. See
[PostgreSQL Sync — `agentsview pg service`](/pg-sync/#agentsview-pg-service) for
setup notes.

```bash
agentsview pg service install
agentsview pg service status
agentsview pg service logs [-f]
agentsview pg service start
agentsview pg service stop
agentsview pg service uninstall
```

| Command     | Description                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `install`   | Generate the service unit, enable it, and start it        |
| `status`    | Show the service-manager status plus last successful push |
| `logs -f`   | Follow `pg-watch.log` under the AgentsView data directory |
| `start`     | Start the installed service                               |
| `stop`      | Stop the installed service                                |
| `uninstall` | Stop and remove the service unit                          |

### `agentsview duckdb`

Mirror the local SQLite archive into DuckDB and serve from it, locally or over
the Quack remote protocol. See [DuckDB Mirror](/duckdb/) for full documentation.

```bash
agentsview duckdb push          # mirror SQLite into sessions.duckdb
agentsview duckdb status        # show mirror sync status
agentsview duckdb serve         # read-only web UI from the mirror
agentsview duckdb quack serve   # expose the mirror over Quack
```

`duckdb push` accepts the same `--full` / `--projects` / `--exclude-projects` /
`--all-projects` / `--watch` / `--debounce` / `--interval` flags as `pg push`.
With `[duckdb].url` or `AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_URL`, `duckdb push`, `duckdb status`,
and `duckdb serve` target the remote Quack endpoint; otherwise they use the
local mirror file. When `[duckdb].path` or `AGENTSVIEW_DUCKDB_PATH` is set,
`duckdb quack serve` exposes that same mirror by default unless `--path`
overrides it. `duckdb serve` accepts the same serve flags as `pg serve`. The
DuckDB backend is unavailable on Windows ARM64 (the upstream bindings ship no
prebuilt library for that platform); all other commands work normally there.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview projects`

List all projects in the local database with their session counts.

```bash
agentsview projects [flags]
```

| Flag       | Default | Description                      |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| `--format` | `human` | Output format: `human` or `json` |
| `--json`   | `false` | Alias for `--format json`        |

**Examples:**

```bash
agentsview projects         # tabular output
agentsview projects --json   # JSON array
```

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview health`

Inspect session intelligence in a human-friendly CLI view. See
[Session Intelligence](/session-intelligence/) for the scoring and signal model.

```bash
agentsview health [session-id] [flags]
```

| Flag       | Default | Description                                            |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--format` | `human` | Output format: `human` or `json`                       |
| `--json`   | `false` | Alias for `--format json`                              |
| `--limit`  | `20`    | Number of sessions to list when no session ID is given |

**Examples:**

```bash
agentsview health
agentsview health --limit 50
agentsview health 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
agentsview health agent-a86574e --json
```

Without a session ID, the command lists recent sessions with grade and outcome
columns. With a session ID, it prints the detailed signal counts for that
session.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview stats`

Experimental window-scoped workspace analytics across sessions and git activity.
See [Stats](/stats/) for the full write-up.

```bash
agentsview stats [flags]
```

| Flag                | Default | Description                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--format`          | `human` | Output format: `human` or `json`                                      |
| `--json`            | `false` | Alias for `--format json`                                             |
| `--since`           | `28d`   | Start of window, either `YYYY-MM-DD` or a compact duration like `28d` |
| `--until`           |         | End of window as `YYYY-MM-DD`                                         |
| `--agent`           | `all`   | Restrict to one agent or use `all`                                    |
| `--include-project` |         | Repeatable project allowlist                                          |
| `--exclude-project` |         | Repeatable project blocklist                                          |
| `--timezone`        | local   | Timezone used for temporal reporting                                  |

**Examples:**

```bash
agentsview stats
agentsview stats --format json --since 2026-04-01 --until 2026-04-15
agentsview stats --agent claude --include-project agentsview
```

The command is experimental. The exact human output may change, and the JSON
output should be treated as a moving surface even though it currently carries
`schema_version: 1`.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview doctor sync`

Collect read-only diagnostics for startup sync decisions. This command does not
create or migrate config files; it loads the current config read-only, inspects
the SQLite archive, checks configured agent roots, and prints recent
sync-related `debug.log` lines.

```bash
agentsview doctor sync
```

The report includes:

- data directory and SQLite database path
- whether the database exists and is readable
- SQLite `user_version` and the binary data version
- the startup sync decision
- session counts by stored data version
- leftover resync temp files
- configured/default agent roots and whether each exists
- recent debug lines mentioning sync, data versions, warnings, or failures
- Antigravity CLI summary-mode counts and Antigravity sessions decoded from
  unrecognized `agy-schema:` fingerprints
- a likely-cause summary when startup sync behavior looks abnormal

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview parse-diff`

Validate parser changes against the real session archive already in your local
SQLite database. The command re-parses source files with the current binary,
normalizes them through the sync path, and reports field-level differences from
the stored rows without writing updated session data.

```bash
agentsview parse-diff [flags]
```

| Flag               | Default | Description                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--agent`          |         | Restrict to one agent; repeatable                                       |
| `--limit`          | `0`     | Maximum number of source files to inspect, newest first (`0` means all) |
| `--fail-on-change` | `false` | Exit non-zero when changes or parse errors are found                    |
| `--format`         | `human` | Output format: `human` or `json`                                        |
| `--json`           | `false` | Alias for `--format json`                                               |
| `--verbose` / `-v` | `false` | Include more detail in the human report                                 |

**Examples:**

```bash
agentsview parse-diff --agent claude --limit 100
agentsview parse-diff --agent codex --fail-on-change
agentsview parse-diff --json > parser-report.json
```

`parse-diff` is intended for parser development and release QA. Run it against a
quiescent, freshly synced archive for the clearest signal. Import-only sources
are skipped because there is no source file to re-parse. Provider-backed stores
with authoritative local sources, including Warp, Forge, Piebald, and Devin, are
covered alongside normal file-backed agents.

The report distinguishes parser drift from comparison-basis skew:

- `raced` means the source changed while `parse-diff` was running. It is
  reported for review but does not fail `--fail-on-change`.
- `incremental_skew` means the stored row was last written by an
  incremental-append sync, so a fresh full re-parse can legitimately differ on
  append-path metadata. It is also reported but excluded from
  `--fail-on-change`.
- `pending_resync` means the stored data version is behind the running binary;
  the next data-version resync rewrites those rows.

If the report includes `incremental_skew`, run a full resync before treating the
archive as a clean parser-drift baseline. A full resync rewrites those rows
through the normalization path and restores strict `parse-diff` scrutiny.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview import`

Import Claude.ai or ChatGPT conversations into the local database. See
[Chat Import](/chat-import/) for full documentation.

```bash
agentsview import --type <type> <path>
```

| Flag     | Default | Description                                      |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `--type` |         | Import type: `claude-ai` or `chatgpt` (required) |

The path can be a `.zip` file, a `conversations.json` file (Claude.ai only), or
a directory containing the extracted export.

**Examples:**

```bash
agentsview import --type claude-ai ~/Downloads/claude.zip
agentsview import --type chatgpt ~/Downloads/chatgpt.zip
agentsview import --type claude-ai ./conversations.json
```

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview export sessions`

Export content-free session summaries from the local archive. See
[Session Export](/session-export/) for the full JSON/NDJSON contract, cursor
semantics, pricing provenance, and project identity rules.

```bash
agentsview export sessions [flags]
```

| Flag                  | Default | Description                                               |
| --------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--format`            | `json`  | Output format: `json` or `ndjson`                         |
| `--limit`             | `500`   | Maximum sessions to return; max `db.MaxSessionLimit`      |
| `--cursor`            |         | Opaque cursor from a previous response                    |
| `--all`               | `false` | Export every eligible page as one output stream           |
| `--project`           |         | Filter by exact project name                              |
| `--exclude-project`   |         | Exclude sessions from the given project                   |
| `--machine`           |         | Filter by machine name                                    |
| `--git-branch`        |         | Filter by project/branch token                            |
| `--agent`             |         | Filter by agent name                                      |
| `--date`              |         | Include sessions started on `YYYY-MM-DD`                  |
| `--date-from`         |         | Include sessions started on or after `YYYY-MM-DD`         |
| `--date-to`           |         | Include sessions started on or before `YYYY-MM-DD`        |
| `--active-since`      |         | Include sessions active since an RFC3339 timestamp        |
| `--min-messages`      | `0`     | Minimum total message count                               |
| `--max-messages`      | `0`     | Maximum total message count                               |
| `--min-user-messages` | `0`     | Minimum user message count                                |
| `--include-one-shot`  | `false` | Include one-shot sessions, which are excluded by default  |
| `--include-automated` | `false` | Include automated sessions, which are excluded by default |
| `--include-children`  | `false` | Include subagent/child sessions                           |
| `--outcome`           |         | Comma-separated outcome filter                            |
| `--health-grade`      |         | Comma-separated health grade filter                       |
| `--min-tool-failures` |         | Minimum tool-failure signal count                         |
| `--has-secret`        | `false` | Only sessions with detected secret leaks                  |

By default, one-shot and automated sessions are excluded, so token and cost
totals can be lower than the full archive unless the corresponding include
flags are used.

**Examples:**

```bash
agentsview export sessions --format json
agentsview export sessions --format ndjson --limit 100
agentsview export sessions --all --format ndjson --project agentsview
```

The JSON top level has `schema_version`, `database_id`, `cursor`, `pricing`,
`projects`, and `sessions`. NDJSON writes the same metadata as the first line,
then one session row per following line. The default and maximum page size is
`db.MaxSessionLimit`, currently 500.

When `--cursor` is present, only `--format`, `--json`, and `--limit` may be
combined with it. Cursor reset errors write structured JSON to stderr, leave
stdout empty, and exit with code 4:

```json
{"error":"cursor_reset","message":"session export cursor is no longer valid; restart the export","database_id":"..."}
```

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview session`

Programmatic access to session data for scripts, automation agents, and CI jobs.
See [Session API](/session-api/) for full documentation, including stability
guarantees, transport auto-detection, and every subcommand.

```bash
agentsview session get <id>              # metadata + signals
agentsview session list [flags]          # filtered list
agentsview session list --resume         # recently-active resume table
agentsview session messages <id>         # paginated messages
agentsview session tool-calls <id>       # flat tool-call list
agentsview session export <id>           # stream raw source file
agentsview session sync <path-or-id>     # parse + insert
agentsview session watch <id>            # NDJSON event stream
agentsview session search <pattern>      # content search across sessions
agentsview session usage <id>            # token usage and cost estimate
```

`session search` supports substring (default), `--regex`, `--fts`,
`--semantic`, and `--hybrid` modes. Semantic and hybrid results can be scoped
with `--scope top|all|subordinate` (default `all`) to include or exclude
sidechain and subagent content — see
[Semantic Search](/semantic-search/#scoping-results-scope).

Structured response commands accept `--format json`; `--json` is a short alias
for that scripting mode. `session export` and `session watch` are the
exceptions: they stream raw bytes and NDJSON respectively, so they reject
`--format`/`--json`. Use `--server <url>` to target an explicit running daemon,
`AGENTSVIEW_SERVER_TOKEN` or `--server-token-file <path>` when that daemon
requires auth, or `--pg` to read from configured PostgreSQL.

`AGENTSVIEW_PG_URL`, a legacy `[pg].url`, or the effective default target from
`default_pg` plus `[pg.NAME]` are sync configuration only; they do not change
the default read path. Read commands use local SQLite unless `--pg` is supplied,
in which case they fail fast if no connection URL is available. Mutating
commands such as `session sync` and local-only raw source export continue to use
the local archive.

Use [`agentsview health`](#agentsview-health) for a human-first signal view and
[Session API](/session-api/) for the full programmatic contract, including
daemon-first transport behavior and markdown export details.

`agentsview session list` renders a resume-oriented human table by default,
including a recently-active marker, session ID, age, agent, project, branch,
message count, title, and working directory. Pass `--resume` or its `--active`
alias to show sessions active in the last 15 minutes; combine either flag with
`--active-since <RFC3339>` to choose a wider or narrower window.

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview embeddings`

Manage the local semantic search embedding index. Requires `[vector]` to be
enabled in config. See [Semantic Search](/semantic-search/) for full
documentation, including configuration and the search surface.

```bash
agentsview embeddings build           # build or refresh the index
agentsview embeddings list            # list embedding generations
agentsview embeddings activate <id>   # activate a generation
agentsview embeddings retire <id>     # retire a generation
```

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview mcp`

Run a read-only Model Context Protocol server for assistant clients that can
call MCP tools. The server exposes session search, listing, overview, message
retrieval, content search, and usage-summary tools over the same service layer
used by the CLI and HTTP API. See [MCP Server](/mcp/) for setup examples and
operational guidance.

```bash
agentsview mcp
agentsview mcp --http 127.0.0.1:8085
agentsview mcp --server http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

By default, `agentsview mcp` speaks stdio, which is the expected transport for
local MCP clients such as Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and Codex.
`--http <addr>` serves StreamableHTTP instead. Bare ports and `:PORT` values
bind to `127.0.0.1`; non-loopback binds require `--http-allow-insecure` plus a
configured bearer token.

Local MCP mode is daemon-backed. Each tool call resolves the local AgentsView
daemon and starts it when needed, so a long-lived MCP server can keep working
after the daemon exits due to idleness. The MCP server does not fall back to
opening the local SQLite archive directly.

Use `--server <url>` to point at an explicit running daemon. When the daemon
requires auth, provide `AGENTSVIEW_SERVER_TOKEN` or
`--server-token-file <path>`. Use `--pg` to read from configured PostgreSQL
directly, or run [`agentsview pg serve`](/pg-sync/#agentsview-pg-serve) and pass
its URL with `--server`.

| Flag                         | Default | Description                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--http <addr>`              |         | Serve StreamableHTTP instead of stdio               |
| `--http-allow-insecure`      | `false` | Allow non-loopback HTTP binds; requires bearer auth |
| `--server <url>`             |         | Explicit daemon URL for MCP tool calls              |
| `--server-token-file <path>` |         | Bearer token file for an explicit daemon URL        |
| `--pg`                       | `false` | Read from configured PostgreSQL                     |

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview secrets`

Scan for and list detected secret leaks across sessions, with matches redacted
by default. See [Secret Scanning](/session-api/#secret-scanning) for the full
detector set, storage shape, and HTTP API.

```bash
agentsview secrets scan [flags]   # scan sessions for leaks
agentsview secrets list [flags]   # list stored findings
```

`secrets scan` walks the archive, applies the full ruleset (definite + candidate
tiers), and writes new findings to the `secret_findings` table. Pass
`--backfill` to scan only sessions that haven't yet been scanned at the current
ruleset version — the inline scan that runs during sync only stamps
definite-tier findings, so `--backfill` is how you pick up the heuristic
candidates without re-scanning the whole archive.

`secrets list` returns redacted findings by default. Pass `--reveal` to print
the raw values — this only works against a localhost-bound daemon and emits a
warning to stderr.

| Flag           | Used by | Description                                                       |
| -------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--format`     | both    | `human` or `json` (inherited from `secrets`)                      |
| `--json`       | both    | Alias for `--format json` (inherited from `secrets`)              |
| `--backfill`   | scan    | Scan only sessions not yet scanned at the current ruleset version |
| `--project`    | both    | Limit to a project                                                |
| `--agent`      | both    | Limit to an agent                                                 |
| `--date-from`  | both    | Sessions on or after `YYYY-MM-DD`                                 |
| `--date-to`    | both    | Sessions on or before `YYYY-MM-DD`                                |
| `--rule`       | list    | Filter by rule name (e.g. `aws-access-key`)                       |
| `--confidence` | list    | `definite`, `candidate`, or `all` (default `definite`)            |
| `--reveal`     | list    | Show unredacted values (localhost-only)                           |
| `--limit`      | list    | Max findings (default 50, max 500)                                |
| `--cursor`     | list    | Pagination cursor from a previous response                        |

______________________________________________________________________

### `agentsview skills`

Install or list the bundled skill files that teach coding-agent harnesses
(Claude Code, Codex, and other `.agents/skills` readers) to search AgentsView
history. See
[Semantic Search](/semantic-search/#skills-for-coding-agents) for what the
skill does and when to re-run it.

```bash
agentsview skills install [--harness claude|agents] [--project] [--force]
agentsview skills list [--project] [--format json]
```

`install` renders the embedded `agentsview-finding-history` skill for each
`--harness` (default both) and writes `SKILL.md` under
`~/.claude/skills/agentsview-finding-history/` and/or
`~/.agents/skills/agentsview-finding-history/`, or under `.claude/skills/` /
`.agents/skills/` at the current git root with `--project`. It overwrites an
unmodified generated file, refuses a hand-edited or foreign file unless
`--force` is passed, and exits non-zero on any refusal. `list` reports
HARNESS, LEVEL, STATE (`missing`, `current`, `stale`, `modified`, `foreign`),
and PATH for every harness.
